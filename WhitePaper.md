<h3 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h5>THE UNIVERSAL WEB (UW)</h5>
<p>The Universal Web is the Web re-imagined. We have come to expect much of the Web from features it never had, weren't intended to have, and to a scale far beyond what it was initially designed for. The UW is built to be a viable & realistic replacement for the modern Web in every way and then some.</p>

<p>The UW addresses the following issues directly: bandwidth crisis, outdated protocols, broken DNS, lack of accountability, lack of identity, reactive security, Domain rules, and web categorization.</p>

<p>At present, we find ourselves continuing to utilize a ruinous medium of interconnected communication on a global scale. Humanity’s demands are exponentially increasing of which the World Wide Web simply can’t meet. As we continue to grow, evolve, and venture beyond the solar system, our imperative task becomes revolutionizing the technology we depend on.</p>

<p>The current state of the World Wide Web is deprecation. If humanity continues to monkey-patch existing problems the Internet will remain the “wild wild west”. Humanity’s ever-increasing demands will never be met by the current state of the Web. We must start thinking in revolutionary terms and not evolutionary. The solution is a complete replacement of contemporary systems, browsers, languages, protocols, and platforms with increased security, speed, efficiency, accountability, trust, identity, capability, and reliability. In order to transition into a new age of information we must replace that which we have become all too comfortable with.</p>

<h5>BANDWIDTH CRISIS - <small>WE PREDICTED IT</small></h5>
<p>Bandwidth is limited, our needs are out growing our networks.To solve this issue we need modern revolutionary technology to replace existing components. If we don’t, fast lanes & prioritization of data is our only option. All those fears that folks have of the repeal of Net Neutrality will be our only hope at keeping the Web spinning. The inevitable rise of IoT, more devices per-person, more devices per-household, self-driving cars, increasing populations, & developing countries coming online suck up bandwidth we don’t have.</p>

<p>We predicted this crisis would occur and then COVID happened. COVID proved that the Web is already close to a breaking point due to the massive stress placed on the Internet from more users sucking up tremendous amounts of bandwidth. COVID proved the bandwidth crisis is very real and right around the corner. We said the bandwidth crisis was a very real concern from the very beginning.</p>

<p>What we are building is the only true option left less we run the risk of economic stagnation, speed lanes, data prioritization, unusable slow performance, and extremely high fees. Imagine a first world nation with a class structure predicated upon Web access. Some will be granted usable fast Web access while others will be forced to pay crushing fees or endure extremely limited access. The economy, job market, government, and society is becoming increasingly dependent upon a fast, cheap, & open Web. Any Web access limitations could be disastrous for average people.</p>

<h4>TECH DEBT - <small>SLOW SPEEDS BIG IMPLICATIONS</small></h4>

<p>HTTP & DNS were built a long time ago without the consideration of modern demands in mind. More and more bandwidth is being sucked up, HTTP continues to show its long known scalability issues, and DNS is lacking in security, performance, scalability, and features. If half of the web can be shut down from DoS-ing specific DNS servers there's an obvious architectural limitation. HTTPS is the current vehicle for our global economy it's essentially the armored car of the Web. The entire digital economy relies on and is transported over HTTPS any modifications to it will result in a change to the economy on a global scale. Any slowing down to the primary components of the Web, (HTTP & DNS), results in missed opportunities or stagnant economic growth across the planet especially in first world countries. DNS & HTTP limit the Web's potential, hinder scalability, are dreadfully slow compared to modern options, lack modern features, negate the ability to redesign core functionality, eat up bandwidth, and cost consumers & businesses billions. There are a plethora of issues and if we don't begin to address them we'll begin to experience an extremely degraded Web experience and at worse rapid economic stagnation. When you factor in all the dollar signs and worse case scenarios one soon realizes that ignoring the Web's shortcomings could result in a global humanitarian crisis for first world nations. There's a lot riding on the Web and when the Web suffers it has a ripple effect that affects us all.</p>

<h4>WEB 3.0 ISN'T THE ANSWER <small> - The Universal Web is.</small></h4>
<p>As apposed to all solely decentralized blockchain based Webs typically referred to as "Web 3.0" or "Web3" the UW seeks to be a truly capable replacement and an ideological one. The UW isn't just a replacement in terms of offering the same functionality but in the true sense of the word. It's a revolutionary replacement capable of outperforming the modern Web using the exact same hardware. The UW doesn't require decentralized consensus as it's truly decentralized by default as is the Web today. A site on the Web today isn't contained in a centralized way much like a Web3 is contained by the rules and laws of the blockchain, network, or consensus algorithm.</p>

<p>We'll summarize one of the core issues of Web3 with a simple logical assertion. Those in physics may appreciate or understand this more so than others. The shortest distance is a straight line between two points. From point A to B is much faster than having to stop midway to B and run a decentralized consensus process. The point is additional processing is always required in order to complete the most basic of requests. The additional step which is required in the Web 3.0 lanscape will always yield a slower result than what the Universal Web does. The UW provides you and the destination the freedom to communicate and operate on your own accord.</p>

<p>We know that the global economy requires a performant & inexpensive web. If a solely decentralized web replaced the modern web, then it would accelerate the bandwidth crisis and bring us to a dystopian web. The term Web 3.0 is not a magic globe, a revolutionary idea, or a solution; it's a cash grab. Trades are happening in nanoseconds the global economy doesn't have time to wait seconds or minutes for a block time to verify and then propagate through the network. A replacement for the web shouldn't be slower and more expensive for consumers. Web 3.0 costs more and they like to hide behind things like it's all on-chain and costs very little to launch an app. The reality is, you get what you pay for. Web 3.0 offsets costs to users instead of the services, which also results in a poorer service. Another common argument is to allow users to control their data. That's no problem, say hello to homomorphic encryption. Instead of tackling this issue from just topology, we need to innovate in every aspect of the web and ask more from our web services. The web's topology problem is minor compared to it's outdated technology problem. If these Web 3.0 projects actually cared about changing the web they would focus on the actual issues.</p>
<br />

<b>How the World Wide Web & Universal Web Work <small>(FASTER)</small></b><br />
<code>REQUEST => EXPECTED PROCESSING => REALITY</code><br />

<b>How the "Web 3.0" Space Works <small>(SLOWER)</small></b><br />
<code>REQUEST => CONSENSUS ALGORITHM => EXPECTED PROCESSING => REALITY</code><br />
<br />

<p>Web3's are limited to the design of their blockchain, decentralized topology, node capacity, and consensus algorithm. An important feature is missing from the Web3 lanscape and that's primarily freedom. The freedom to design an application and service that relies on one's own resources is entirely lacking in the Web3 world. Another feature that is lacking because it breaks the blockchain is deletion. Another missing feature which defeats the purpose of such Web3 network's principles and intentions is censorship or blacklisting. In the Web3s of today apps must be restricted to or confined to the networks blockchain, consensus algorithm, and rules. Essentially applications are limited by the rules of the network itself. Whereas in a Web based on equal opportunity rather than equal outcome such as the World Wide Web &  Universal Web applications are only limited by their own resources. Resources which they directly own, control, or freely participate in.</p>

<p>The entirety of the "crypto" Web3 space consists of the polar opposite of what we are building. Because Web3 requires an additional process to form consensus regardless of how complex, fast, simple, or what advancements it makes in the future the fact that it exists means it will always take more time to complete a request in a Web3 world compared to the design of the modern World Wide Web or in our case the Universal Web. This is a huge error in rational and logical thinking that dictates that no such replacement should ever take place that involves Web3 replacing the WWWW. Unless we are under tyrannical rule, have no care for speed, nor care for cost, and are being unilaterally censored there is no reason to replace the current topology with a solely blockchain decentralized based Web.</p>

<h3 align="center">TECHNOLOGY</h3>

<br/>

<h4>EXPANDED TOPOLOGY</h4>
<p>From a topology standpoint the UW is a hybrid web (centralized focused but enhanced by decentralized components). The network is designed to go beyond the capabilities that any solely centralized or decentralized network could offer. Centralized components provide early protections and ensure equal or better performance than the WWW. The WWW doesn't provide a unified way to take advantage of decentralized technology that can enhance its core functions. DNS is an existing function which can take advantage of decentralized technology to expand availability and increase performance. A new decentralized feature is the delivery of typical static Web assets via a Web wide decentralized CDN. Allowing all of the Web to participate is key to adoption and expantion. These decentralized options can be taken advantage of based on the client's and the service's discretion.</p>

<h5>TLDR; Both topologies have their use cases but together they're a solution for the Web.</h5>

<p align="center">TOPOLOGY OVERVIEW SUMMARY COMPARISON</p>
<p align="center">THE BEST OF BOTH</p>
<br />

<p>The WWW doesn't provide a unified way to take advantage of decentralized technology which can enhance its core functions. DNS is an existing function which can take advantage of decentralized technology to expand availability and increase performance. Delivery of typical static Web assets require a unified decentralized CDN so that all of the Web can participate. These decentralized options can be incentivized by introducing a native integrated cryptocurrency hence Viat. By expanding the Web's topology to incorporate a hybrid approach it can take advantage of the features that come along with such networks yet it can also remain impervious to the downsides of it because it isn't reliant on them. Although the attack surface increases this allows clients and services to simply gravitate or lean on the centralized or decentralized varieties of individual components. Allowing them to remain operational in more scenarios while operating at the best possible performance.</p>

<br />
<h4>PROTOCOL</h4>

<h5>UNIVERSAL DATA STREAM PROTOCOL - <small>(UDSP)</small></h5>

<p><b>UDSP is a UDP based low-latency, real-time, bi-directional, encryption enforced, and reliable Data Transport Protocol.</b></p>

<p>The first step in the construction of the Universal Web is to replace HTTP entirely with UDSP. On the Universal Web all communication, streaming, or transferring of any type of data utilizes UDSP. When visiting a site on the Universal Web UDSP is the protocol used instead of HTTP. Specific UDSP client and server modules are required to visit or host a website on the Sentivate Network. UDSP is the foundation and blood cells of the Universal Web.</p>

<p>UDSP is capable of dynamic reliability on a connection level, or on a per-request basis which is agreed upon between the involved parties. Unlike HTTP, UDSP enforces encryption which means all UDSP connections are encrypted by default, no exceptions. UDSP supports IPv6, Multiplexing, Multihoming, and perfect-forward-secrecy.</p>

<p>UDSP is conceptually a merger of the functionality you'd expect from HTTP & Websockets. UDSP is designed to be kept open for the life cycle of the app and requests are to be sent over that one singular connection. Since connections are bi-directional streams and less chatty this conserves bandwidth and ensures low-latency for the livelihood of the connection. UDSP is far less chatty than HTTP and can be programmatically set to adjust it's own reliability standards. This makes UDSP a highly useful protocol where high-throughput, low-latency, and high reliability are required. Due to UDSP's programmatic dynamic nature, it's efficacious in situations of highly variable and or degraded network connectivity.</p>

<p>UDSP has optional puzzles included in the packets which allow providers and solvers to earn VIAT. Puzzles can vary and thus the puzzles are a Dynamic-Proof-of-Work. The puzzles may be encapsulated or point to data that is required for solving the puzzle. This functionality will be described in the next white paper for VIAT. The puzzles also function as congestion control and a way to limit the potential damages from DDOS attacks. Sentivate turns a typical DDOS attack into profit by the introduction of various puzzle types into packets. When a client solves the served puzzle the client and domain are credited by the network with Viat. If a server is under DDOS attack then the server can dynamically change the reward split up-to 100% for the domain. This ensures the attackers suffer more financial loss and have little to gain. Puzzles ensure that both parties have an incentive to act in good faith.</p>

<br />

<h4>UNIVERSAL DOMAIN SYSTEM</h4>

<h5>DOMAIN CERTIFICATES</h5>

<br />

<h5>ROUTING & CRYPTOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS</h5>

<p>Domain certificates provide routing, cryptography, and additional details associated with a hostname. Domain certificates are signed by 3 or more keypairs: Ephemeral, Master, and an authorized Domain Registrar. In order to establish a successful handshake, the domain certificate and a valid signature is required.</p>

<p>The domain's ephemeral certificate also acts as a wallet which stores funds for any puzzles it distributes to clients. A portion of the mined Viat is sent to the ephemeral certificates wallet address.</p>

<br />

<h5>DOMAIN REGISTRAR</h5>

<br />

<h5>UPLOAD & SIGN DOMAIN CERTIFICATES</h5>

<p>The Domain Registrar, (DR), is used to register a domain and manage a domain's public certificate. The DR validates & signs the public certificates associated with the hostname. The DR then passes the certificate to the Domain Information System which stores the certificate for distribution.</p>

<br />

<h5>DOMAIN INFORMATION SYSTEM</h5>

<br />

<h5>QUERY DOMAIN ROUTING AND CRYPTOGRAPHY</h5>

<p>The Domain Information System, (DIS), returns domain-specific information in the form of a domain certificate from human-readable hostnames. The DIS returns the domain’s certificate which includes cryptographic details & routing information. By including the hostnames cryptography along with routing information, 0-RTT is possible without requiring the client to have visited the domain prior. This is a unique advantage over TLS 1.3 in that 0-RTT is available by default where as in TLS 1.3 one would need to have visited the site prior. Before clients connect to a website they must first query the DIS with a human-readable hostname. The DIS has centralized servers and a decentralized network to provide clients with the fastest possible way to access domain certificates.</p>

<p>The DIS acts as another layer of defence from malicious certificate related attacks. When invalid certificates are used to request information from the DIS to go to a service the DIS simply denys returning a response.</p>

<p>The decentralized nodes providing domain certificates have a chance to earn Viat through their services. This functionality will be covered in-depth with the Viat white paper.</p>

![DIS](https://sentivate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SentivateInfographicDIS.png)

<br />

<h5>DOMAINS</h5>

<br />

<h5>HUMAN READABLE HOSTNAMES</h5>

<p>Domains on Sentivate have full extension names and can have single full names for trademarked entities. The domain rules and regulations are designed to organize the web, free up domain names for new companies, protect trademarks, limit malicious activity, and make extensions more descriptive.</p>

<p>For example, one can navigate to Amazon by simply typing Amazon into the Sentivate browser. Domain rules are stricter on the Sentivate network. Domain squatting is entirely disallowed, there is a use it or lose it policy. Domain content or service must be relevant to the domain extension. For example, Amazon's store must use the store domain extension, "Amazon.store". There are shorthand domain extensions available for certain domains. For example, Amazon's company website must utilize the company extension, Amazon.company or the shorthand variant Amazon.com. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are cryptocurrencies and sites dedicated to them must use the cryptocurrency extension. However, a news site related to say bitcoin must use the .news and or .blog extension. Any domain that may have random and or arbitrary content must use the .abstract extension.</p>

<br />
<h4>UNIVERSAL IDENTITY SYSTEM</h4>

<h3>IDENTITY CERTIFICATES</h3>

<h3>EPHEMERAL & MASTER KEY PAIRS</h3>

<p>Identity certificates, (IC), are documents which provide cryptographic details that represent you on the network and are signed by a Identity Registrar. An identity certificate has two cryptographic key pairs: Master and Ephemeral. A master key pair is used specifically for signing ephemeral certificates and is the core identifying key pair. Ephemeral key pairs can be replaced at the owner's discretion. Identity certificates cryptographically authenticate & authorize clients on the network.</p>

<p>Ephemeral Certificates, (EC), are a sub-certificate to the Master Certificate. EC's act as profiles which are used to access user defined services. For example, wallet certificate, banking certificate, general web browsing certificate or for every service. However, one can choose to utilize one single ephemeral certificate for all services. ECs are used for the key exchange process which sets up a bi-directional UDSP connection between the origin and host.</p>

<p>Users can instantly signup, login, and purchase an item with their identity certificate. Servers require a client certificate upon connection to establish a successful UDSP handshake.</p>

<p>Identity certificates form the basis for a decentralized reputation system, which can publicly record good & bad behavior associated with specific certificates. A honeypot can be used to block known bad actors from accessing a service further securing the network.</p>

<p>Identity certificates can be linked to real world identities and assets. Making Sentivate an ideal platform for secure, private, and verifiable voting in elections. Stores and companies can have verified ICs which allow users to directly pay or donate through Viat.</p>

<h3>IDENTITY REGISTRAR</h3>
<h3>VALIDATE AND SIGN</h3>

<p>The Identity Registrar, (IR), is a service which signs certificates & is the first layer of protection for the network. The IR protects the network by filtering faulty certificates, stopping Sybil attacks, and nefarious actors. The Identity Registrar ensures malicious certificates aren’t signed which allows services to efficiently deny their connection attempts. False signatures can be denied by the DIS and therefore potentially protect a service and save some of its resources before hand.</p>

<p>A decentralized network and acyclic blockchain will be leveraged to help validate newly submitted certificates for signing. If the certificated is successfully vetted by the network the IR signs the certificate. Then it can be successfully used by services and the DIS. During the initial handshake, the first packet contains the certificates required to establish a UDSP stream. If signatures are successfully validated the rest of the handshake process continues else it fails.</p>

<p>Active certificates will continually be updated and signed. When a certificate is re-signed, another field is added to the certificate which shows the elapsed time since the previous signing of the certificate. This provides services with an extra layer of trust for certain certificates.</p>

<h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>

<h3>hApps</h3>

<h3>HYBRID UNIVERSAL WEB APPS</h3>

Hybrid apps are self-constructing, streaming single-page-applications. Hybrid apps are built using reactive, dynamic, and modular development methodologies. hApps have all the benefits of centralized & decentralized networks ensuring the highest scalability potential.

hApps’ assets are contained in their own file and are streamed to the client on an as needed basis. hApps are streamed and built over time much like a bridge building itself as you walk across. Only one initial page load takes place and thereafter pages are dynamically built as needed similar to Single-page-apps. Only exactly when the client needs the resource is when it will be fetched and delivered.

Sentivate’s components allow for highly modular asset streaming. For example, components can share the same CSS or HTML assets which ensures shared assets are only downloaded once and the duplicate code is never sent over the wire. Server loads and bandwidth is drastically decreased with this methodology as now the client is only pulling exactly what is needed.

Hybrid Apps can utilize an opt-in decentralized P2P CDN for assets in addition to the destination service. Making use of a Hybrid Content Delivery Network means that hybrid apps have high availability, scalability, and more bandwidth.

hApps validate, authenticate, and authorize clients automatically during the initial connection handshake. hApps backends can store and reference clients by their public key or full certificates. Think of it as oAuth for the entire Internet. Services no longer need to worry about hashing, storing, and or encrypting passwords. Clients can quickly login on the click of a button or automatically by simply connecting to the service. Users no longer need to remember or create complex passwords as using their keypair is more secure and easier to use. If services do not require you to have a username they can simply rely on your public key as your identifying name. This means that for some services users don't have to create a username and password during the registration process.
